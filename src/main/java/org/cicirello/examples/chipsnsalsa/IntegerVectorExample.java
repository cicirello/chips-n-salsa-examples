/**
 * This example demonstrates how to use simulated annealing for an integer-valued
 * optimization problem, where we are searching for a vector of integers that optimizes
 * an integer-valued objective function.  The example is specifically of a problem that this
 * library calls BoundMax.  BoundMax is a generalization of the well-known problem OneMax, 
 * which is often used in benchmarking genetic algorithms and other forms of evolutionary 
 * computation.  In the OneMax problem, we are searching for a vector of bits of a specified length
 * that maximizes the number of bits equal to a 1.  The optimal solution is obviously
 * all 1s.  In BoundMax, instead of a vector of bits, we are optimizing a vector of integers.
 * The integers in the vector are in the interval, [0,B], where B is the bound.  
 * And the problem is to search for
 * the vector that maximizes the number of integers equal to B. 
 * The library includes an IntegerVector class for representing solutions to 
 * optimization problems with a vector of integers, as well as mutation operators for use
 * with simulated annealing
