/**
 * This example demonstrates how to use simulated annealing for an optimization problem, where we
 * are searching for a permutation that optimizes some objective function. The example is
 * specifically of the Permutation in a Haystack problem, which is an optimization problem used in
 * benchmarking algorithms for permutation optimization. In the Permutation in a Haystack problem,
 * we are searching for a permutation of a specified length that minimizes the distance to a target
 * permutation. The optimal solution is obviously the target permutation itself. The choice of
 * distance function enables controlling the topology of the search space. The library includes a
 * large number of mutation operators for permutations.
