/**
 * This example demonstrates how to use simulated annealing for an integer-valued optimization
 * problem (i.e., cost function is integer-valued), where we are searching for a vector of bits that
 * optimizes some objective. The example is specifically of the OneMax problem, which is often used
 * in benchmarking genetic algorithms and other forms of evolutionary computation. In the OneMax
 * problem, we are searching for a vector of bits of a specified length that maximizes the number of
 * bits equal to a 1. The optimal solution is obviously all 1s. The library includes a BitVector
 * class for representing solutions to optimization problems with a vector of bits. A BitVector is
 * an indexable vector of bits. The library also includes two variations of bit-flip mutation,
 * commonly used in genetic algorithms, although here in this example we use it with simulated
 * annealing.
