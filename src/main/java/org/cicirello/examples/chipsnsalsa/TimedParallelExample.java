/**
 * This example demonstrates how to use the TimedParallelMultistarter class to execute a parallel
 * multistart simulated annealer for a specified length of time. The example uses the OneMax
 * problem, which is a problem often used to benchmark genetic algorithms. In the OneMax problem,
 * you are searching the space of vectors of bits of a specified length for the vector consisting of
 * all 1s (e.g., maximizing the number of 1s in the bit vector).
