/**
 * This example demonstrates how to use a hybrid of simulated annealing and hill climbing for an
 * optimization problem, where we are searching for a permutation that optimizes
 * some objective function.  At the completion of 
 * the simulated annealing run, the search will apply
 * a hill climber to further locally optimize the solution before returning. 
 * The example is specifically of the Permutation in a Haystack problem, 
 * which is an optimization problem used in benchmarking algorithms for permutation optimization.
 * In the Permutation in a Haystack problem, we are 
 * searching for a permutation of a specified length
 * that minimizes the distance to a target permutation.  The optimal solution is obviously
 * the target permutation itself.  The choice of distance 
 * function enables controlling the topology
 * of the search space.  The library includes a large 
 * number of mutation operators for permutations.

		// In this example, our optimization problem is a benchmarking problem
		// known as the "Permutation in a Haystack".  To generate an instance
		// of this problem, we need to choose a distance metric on permutations as
		// well as decide the length of permutations we are optimizing.  This example
		// uses a distance metric known as Cyclic Edge Distance.

		// Simulated annealing needs to be able to initialize the search with a random 
		// starting point.  The parameter indicates the length of the permutations to generate.
		PermutationInitializer initializer = new PermutationInitializer(N);
		
		// We need a mutation operator for simulated annealing.
		// There are a large number of mutation operators for mutations
		// available in the library to choose from.  
		// This example uses Insertion Mutation, which
		// randomly removes an element from the permutation, and then
		// reinserts it at a different randomly chosen index. 
		//
		// Further, the InsertionMutation also implements the IterableMutationOperator 
		// interface, so it can be used for the hill climber as well as for the 
		// simulated annealer, although there is no requirement to use the same 
		// mutation operator for both.
		InsertionMutation mutation = new InsertionMutation();

		// Steepest Descent.

		// Create the simulated annealer, giving it the problem to solve, the 
		// mutation operator, the initializer, and the hill climber.  
		// This example uses the default
		// annealing schedule, the Self-Tuning Lam schedule.  There are other
		// constructors that allow specifying a different annealing schedule.
		// The library uses generics so that simulated annealing can easily be applied
		// to optimizing a variety of types of structures.  So we need to specify the
		// type under optimization, in this example Permutation.

		// Run the simulated annealer.  The parameter of 1000 means to run
		// 1000 iterations (i.e., an iteration involves generating a random neighbor with
		// the mutation operator, and deciding whether or not to keep it or revert back).
		SolutionCostPair<Permutation> solution = sa.optimize(1000);
		
		// The returned object of the optimize method above contains
		// the end of run solution.  The getSolution method accesses it.
		Permutation x = solution.getSolution();
		
		// The SolutionCostPair object returned by optimize also contains
		// the cost of that solution (in terms of the optimization criteria).

		// between the solution Permutation and the target permutation (the permutation
		// with the N elements in numerical order).

		// use it where a String is expected, such as in the concatenation below.
		System.out.println("End of run solution is:\n" + x + ",\nwith cost of " + cost);
		
		// The ProgressTracker contained in the SimulatedAnnealing object

		// the best of run solution may be different than the end of run solution.
